    "Turning on Smart Filters helps you easily apply a set of filters to every job search you make, helping you to find the jobs you want, and eliminating results that don't apply to you. Smart Filters work especially well if your searches are tied to a specific location, job title, or company. If the Smart Filters slider is set to On, your searches will only return results that fit the Smart Filters you have set. You can change these filters at any time. To turn off Smart Filters, change the Smart Filters setting to Off."

Saving job searches makes it easier to check important search terms each time you come to JobOps, so you don't have to search from scratch each time you come to JobOps. You can start saving searches that are relevant to you, or you can update your MOC code in <a href='/users'>your profile</a> to generate some recommended saved searches."
