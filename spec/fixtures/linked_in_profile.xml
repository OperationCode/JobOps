      <summary>Inaugural class of 2011 Code for America Fellows

In the inaugural class of 2011 Code for America Fellows 361 people applied and 20 were chosen as the first class of fellows.

Over this past year I have had a chance to work on a wide arrange of projects.  I spent the month of February learning about the City of Boston which also includes Boston Public Schools, Boston Public Library as well as the after school programs.

I also worked on different open source applications such as creating Ruby gems for different government APIs.  Part of my time spent here was working on a Solar Widget for the ArcGIS Flex viewer which determines solar power for a rooftop.</summary>
